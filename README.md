Introduction
This repository contains the code and analysis for the FIFA 21 Dataset Assignment. In this assignment, we will be working with the FIFA 21 dataset, which contains information about football players, their attributes, and various other details.

FIFA 21 Dataset
Overview
This dataset contains information about football players from the FIFA 21 video game. The dataset includes player attributes such as age, nationality, overall rating, potential rating, preferred foot, and various skill ratings. The data provides insights into the performance and characteristics of different players in the game.

Files Description
FIFA21_dataset.csv: This CSV file contains the FIFA 21 dataset with player attributes and details.
Tasks
The following tasks are performed in the analysis:

Data Loading and Exploration: Load the dataset, understand its structure, and explore basic statistics and information about the data.

Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and convert categorical variables into numerical format.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze the distribution of player attributes, explore player nationality, and examine the relationship between various attributes.

Machine Learning Models: Implement machine learning models to predict player ratings based on their attributes.

Evaluation Metrics: Evaluate the performance of the machine learning models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
