Machine Learning & AI Assignment
Objective
The objective of this assignment is to explore advanced Python tools for machine learning. We will be utilizing publicly available datasets from the provided GitHub repositories to perform data exploration, preprocessing, implement machine learning models, and visualize the results using Python programming.

Dataset Selection
For this assignment, we have chosen two datasets from the provided GitHub repositories:

Dataset: FIFA-21 Complete Dataset

Dataset - FIFA-21 Complete Dataset
The FIFA-21 Complete Dataset contains information about football players, including attributes like name, nationality, position, overall rating, age, hits, potential, and team. This dataset is relevant to machine learning tasks as we can use it to predict player performance based on various attributes and explore patterns within the data related to player attributes and overall ratings.

Tasks
We will complete the following tasks using Python programming for the dataset:

Dataset Selection: Justify the dataset selection based on its relevance to machine learning tasks and its potential for analysis.

Data Exploration with Python: Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset. Generate summary statistics, identify data types, and visualize the data distribution.

Data Preprocessing with Python: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and performing feature engineering to prepare it for machine learning models.

Implement Machine Learning Models with Python: Implement at least two different machine learning models (e.g., SVM, Random Forest, Neural Network) for each dataset using Python. Evaluate and compare the performance of each model using appropriate metrics to determine the most suitable model for the dataset.

Visualization with Python: Create meaningful visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to represent the dataset and analysis results clearly and insightfully.

Folder Structure
The repository structure for this assignment will be as follows:
